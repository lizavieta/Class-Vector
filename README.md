# Description 

The Vector class is a dynamic array implementation in C++ designed to manage collections of elements with efficient memory usage and access patterns. This class is templated, allowing it to handle elements of any type, making it versatile for a wide range of applications. It supports various standard operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements. Additionally, the Vector class includes iterator support to ensure compatibility with Standard Template Library (STL) algorithms.
